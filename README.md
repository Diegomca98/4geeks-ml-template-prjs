# Machine Learning Web App using Flask - Project Tutorial

- Search and understand a new dataset.
- Model the data using a Machine Learning, Deep Learning or NLP algorithm.
- Analyze the results and optimize the model.
- Integrate it into Render using a Flask-based application.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Find a dataset
Research different online sources about different datasets that you could use to train a model. You can use some public API, the UCI repository for Machine Learning or the Kaggle section of [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), among many other sources. Remember to look for a simple dataset as this is not the final project of the course.

### Step 2: Develop a model
Once you have found your ideal data set, analyze it and train a model. Optimize it if necessary.

### Step 3: Develop a web application using Flask
With the knowledge acquired in this module, develop an interface to be able to use the model. Give it the style that suits you best and note the external resources you have used for the development.

### Step 4: Integrate the model and the application in Render
Create a free service in Render and integrate the work you have done to be able to deploy the web application online. Don't forget to include the link to the service in your repository.
