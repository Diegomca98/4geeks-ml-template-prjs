# Template for Machine Learning projects

#### Module 13. Exploratory Data Analysis (Branch exploratory-data-analysis)
> Find patterns in your data in order to get insights and valuable information. Use that information to make decisions and generate better predictions. If your data is garbage, the output will be garbage: Clean your data to avoid poor quality outputs.

#### Module 14. Your first ML Alorithm (Branch: logistic-regression)
> During this module you will learn the basics of machine learning, the evaluation metrics and how to optimize your ML algo. We will start our journey with logistic regressions.

#### Module 15. Linear Regression (Branch: linear-regression)
> Read the linear regression theory and run the code in the exploring linear regression notebook to practice. Then go to your project and predict the cost of a medical insurance using Linear Regression
